The Emma Emarketing plugin allows you to quickly and easily add a signup form for your Emma list as a widget or a shortcode on your WordPress 3.0 or higher site.

After the plugin is installed, the setup page will guide you through entering your Emma API login information, selecting your group, setting up the fields for your form, customizing the form, and then adding the Widget to your site. The great news is that this whole process will take less than five minutes and everything can be done via the WordPress Dashboard Setting GUI â€“ no file editing at all!
